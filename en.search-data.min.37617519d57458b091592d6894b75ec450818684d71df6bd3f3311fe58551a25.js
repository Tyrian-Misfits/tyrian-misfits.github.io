The remaining two slots are where we can get creative.\nAt its most simplistic, builds are described in terms of role (DPS vs. support) and position (frontline vs. backline).\nRole\r#\r\rIn an ideal comp, nobody is a one-trick pony. But it\u0026rsquo;s important to know what your primary role is. It guides all the decisions you make.\nDPS builds run stats that focus on damage, which makes them squishy, and their choice of utility skills will generally lean towards maximizing damage.\nSupport builds run stats that focus on healing and boon duration, and their job is to allow the DPSers to do the maximum amount of damage.\nYes there are hybrid builds, but in a solid comp, you will generally favour specialists over generalists. It\u0026rsquo;s simply more effective.\nPosition\r#\r\rFrontline builds are designed to be right in the thick of things; they\u0026rsquo;re tanky. Frontline DPS builds focus on burst damage and CC, keeping enemies occupied and away from the back line. Frontline support builds typically provide offensive boons and conditions to help the DPSers do as much damage as possible in a push.\nBackline builds hold back, but just a little. Unless you have supports dedicated to you, it\u0026rsquo;s important to stay within, say, 900 units of the tag. That\u0026rsquo;s where most of the support is focused.\nBackline DPS builds focus on ranged weapons and can typically do massive amounts of damage, but they tend to crumble in a frontal assault. Backline supports will help with reflects and other defensive boons to keep the back line mobile and effective.\n"}),a.add({id:2,href:'/docs/wvw/etiquette/',title:"Etiquette",section:"WvW 101",content:"Etiquette\r#\r\rRunning with a squad is like a team sport. To be successful, everyone should understand the fundamentals and adhere to certain basic \u0026ldquo;rules.\u0026rdquo; These basic rules of etiquette apply to any squad you may find yourself in.\n  Stay on tag. We cannot stress this enough. If you can\u0026rsquo;t see the tag, you are probably in the wrong place.\n  Trust your commander. Even if the lord is at 5%, if the tag says to follow, do it. It might be a mistake, but you only hurt the commander\u0026rsquo;s plan by not being there when they need you. Commanders do make mistakes. It\u0026rsquo;s OK. It\u0026rsquo;s how we learn.\n  When you are not on tag, you create a \u0026ldquo;tail.\u0026rdquo; This means that when a fight is engaged, not everybody will be there at the same time. This can lead to avoidable wipes.\n  When you are not on tag and you have supply, then our count of available supply will be off. This can lead to wasted siege or dangerous delays that can lead to wipes.\n  There are roamers that follow squads just to pick off their tails. As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re not on tag, you\u0026rsquo;re a bag.\u0026rdquo; It is much safer to be with the main body of the squad.\n    Don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;squirrel.\u0026rdquo; This is the main reason people end up off tag, and often end up dead. Squirreling is when you leave the group to go after an enemy. If you want to roam, that\u0026rsquo;s totally fine! But then you should leave the squad. If you are in the squad, you should be with the squad.\nIf you do chose to squirrel and find yourself in trouble, please do not call out for help. We can\u0026rsquo;t be turning around a 30-man squad to chase one roamer. Chalk it up to experience and make your way back to the tag as quickly as you can.\n  Be in voice comms if you can. You should not feel pressured to participate. You can mute. But it is very helpful if you can hear what the commander is saying. If you can\u0026rsquo;t join voice, do be very attentive to squad chat and where the tag is going.\n  Keep voice comms clear during fights. The live banter is the heart and soul of a guild run. We love it! But when things get hot, please put down the conversation and give the commander the room not just to think but to communicate clearly to the rest of the squad.\n  If you are defeated, unless victory is imminent, waypoint and make your way back to squad as quickly as you can.\n  Never throw siege. This is the commander\u0026rsquo;s sole prerogative.\n  When sieging an objective, here\u0026rsquo;s the order of operations:\n First clear enemy rams or catapults in the way. Then build any siege the commander drops. And build fast! If you have supply, and you see something that needs building, build it! If you are a healer or support with reflects, stay with the siege and protect it. If you have ranged damage, clear the walls of guards, siege, and squirrels. Otherwise, if you have siege mastery, use any available siege. Everyone else, see rule #1.    Don\u0026rsquo;t claim objectives unless told to. Please leave that decision up to the commander or delegate.\n  Hide your miniatures when in WvW. They don\u0026rsquo;t stealth and give away our position.\n  When stacking, get off your mount unless the commander tells you to mount up. You can\u0026rsquo;t stealth while mounted.\n  When the commander calls \u0026ldquo;stealth\u0026rdquo;, stop using any skills unless you know they won\u0026rsquo;t interfere. See the Commander Calls page for more details.\n  "}),a.add({id:3,href:'/docs/wvw/builds/guardian/',title:"Guardian",section:"Builds",content:"Guardian\r#\r\rGW2Mists lists multiple guardian builds. The most common, and the one we need for every single party in the zerg, is the Healbrand. The others can be slotted in to the flex spots, but they cannot replace a proper Healbrand.\nNotes on Firebrand Tomes\r#\r\rAnet did what they could to make the tomes quite straightforward to use. The Firebrand page on the GW2 wiki makes it easy to see what they all do. Here we refer to F1 as the Fire Tome, F2 as the Heal Tome, and F3 as the Boon Tome.\nThe Fire Tome focuses on burn damage. The Heal Tome gives you regen, healing, and condi cleanse. The Boon Tome gives you stability, protection, resistance, and reflect.\nThe skills for the three tomes all work in similar ways:\n Skill 1 sprays out in front of you in a cone. Skill 2 is a close-range AoE (240). Skill 3 is a targeted AoE (range 900, radius 240). Skill 4 is a medium-radius AoE (360) that also drops a combo field. Skill 5 is a large-radius AoE (600) that also grants special boons to allies.  Healbrand\r#\r\rThe core GW2Mists Healbrand build is perfectly serviceable, but there are minor variants.\nFrontline Aggressive (Commander)\r#\r\rFrontline Aggressive Healbrand\nThis is the build our commander tends to run. You\u0026rsquo;ll note the extra offensive mantras and the use of the axe, which gives a helpful pull when running down fleeing squirrels.\nFirebrand commanders will still often have an additional firebrand in their party to ensure survivability.\nBoon Focused\r#\r\rGuardian healing will never compare with that of scrappers and even tempests. But guardians give a ton of helpful boons. So maximizing boon duration over healing power is also acceptable.\nBoon-Focused Healbrand\nThis build uses the standard mace for its defensive boons (skill #3 in particular) and Concentration sigils over Transference. It chooses Indomitable Courage over Battle Presence for the extra stability, and Magnanimous Maintenance Oil over the Bountiful for the extra boon duration (it is also significantly cheaper).\nRune of Water is a valid choice over Rune of the Monk.\nUtility Skills\r#\r\rYou will almost always run at the very least Mantra of Liberation as your elite and Mantra of Lore. \u0026ldquo;Stand Your Ground!\u0026rdquo; is another staple.\nMost heal slots are occupied with Mantra of Solace, but some do choose \u0026ldquo;Receive the Light!\u0026rdquo;.\nThat leaves one slot that can change depending on party and enemy composition. Here are the most common choices:\n Hallowed Ground: Fire field that grants pulsing stability (and quickness and retaliation, with the right traits). Purging Flames: Pulsing fire damage and condition cleanse. Signet of Mercy: Passively increases boon duration and revives downed allies. Wall of Reflection: Long-lasting projectile reflect, particularly useful at choke points.  Trait Options\r#\r\r Firebrand The standard choice for Firebrand column 2 is Stalwart Speed. But it has a 7 second internal cooldown. If your party is getting quickness from elsewhere, Legendary Lore is a good alternative. Honor Even if you\u0026rsquo;re not using a mace, Invigorated Bulwark is usually the best choice, but Protective Reviver is defensible without a mace. Pure of Voice is super helpful for \u0026ldquo;Stand Your Ground!\u0026rdquo;, but Force of Will is acceptable if you need increased healing output.\n  Personal Notes\r#\r\rHaele\r#\r\rI run the boon-focused build. \u0026ldquo;Stand Your Ground!\u0026rdquo; and empower last over 10 seconds. Boon Tome 5 stability and protection lasts 9. Aegis from mace 3 lasts over 14 seconds, and shield 4 for over 7.\nWhen stacking, I use staff 4 then 2. If we have a distance to run, then I\u0026rsquo;ll stay in staff and use staff 3 for swiftness or 5 for the line. I\u0026rsquo;ll generally pop \u0026ldquo;Stand Your Ground!\u0026rdquo; one our way to the encounter.\nAs we get within range, I\u0026rsquo;ll pop shield 5, and once we hit, shield 4 and mace 3 come out. From there, you have to see how the encounter is going.\nI favour the Boon Tome. Skills 5 and 4 are staples. If things are going well, then I may switch to Fire Tome for the skill 3 pull. I generally won\u0026rsquo;t switch to Heal Tome unless things are really dire or our scrapper has somehow succumbed.\nWhile you should generally not jeopardize your own life to help stragglers, you\u0026rsquo;re a guardian after all. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to resist. When we\u0026rsquo;re disengaging, there are things you can do to help. Turn around to face the tail and use shield 4, heal mantra, elite mantra, or Boon Tome 1 to help people catch up or avoid a pull.\nYou can watch me play on my Twitch channel.\n"}),a.add({id:4,href:'/docs/wvw/calls/',title:"Commander Calls",section:"WvW 101",content:"Commander Calls\r#\r\rYou may hear the commander call out various words and phrases at certain points. Here\u0026rsquo;s what they mean. Don\u0026rsquo;t ever hesitate to ask, either in the chat or in Discord, if you have any questions or would like to see new terms added.\n blast This is usually called right after stealth. It means to use a blast finisher skill inside of a smoke field to create area stealth. See stealth for details. bomb This means to do the maximum amount of damage you can at that moment and in that place. For supports, it\u0026rsquo;s the time you pull out all the stops to ensure the DPSers in your party are maximally effective (e.g., quickness, alacrity, might, Winds of Disenchantment). It is generally wise to save your big skills for these calls. Sure, DPSers want to be doing damage all the time, but when everybody coordinates, it\u0026rsquo;s amazing how quickly you can destroy an enemy blob. So try to save a little for these calls.\n finish the downs Means to backtrack a little and be sure to finish all the of the downed enemies. This usually means \u0026ldquo;cleave,\u0026rdquo; meaning do as much damage as you can. \u0026ldquo;Stomping\u0026rdquo; (pressing the Finish key) generally takes too long. might up This typically refers to the Guardian staff 4 skill Empower, but you can use any skill that grants might to allies. pvd Means \u0026ldquo;player vs. door.\u0026rdquo; When called, it means to use your autoattack on the gate being sieged. We often do this if the gate is low and the rams have been disabled. stack; stack up It simply means get on tag. This is so, so important. Stealth, might, healing, all of it relies on people being close together. So stack up! When stacking, always dismount! Also, do not use any skills that create a combo field unless ordered to do so.\n stealth Some classes have skills that create a smoke field. When smoke fields are blasted, they give stealth to people within the field. For this to work, you must keep in mind the following:  Hide your minatures in WvW. They don\u0026rsquo;t stealth and give away our position. Get off your mount. You can\u0026rsquo;t stealth while mounted. When stealth is called, do not use any skill that creates a combo field other than smoke! This is so important! Do not use any skill once stealth has been called unless you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. Once the smoke fields are down, if you have a blast finisher, use it immediately, but then do not use any other skill, to avoid revealing yourself.   sustain Refers to skills that keep the group alive, such as healing, cleansing, and aegis. water Refers to healing. You might hear terms like \u0026ldquo;big water\u0026rdquo; vs. \u0026ldquo;small water.\u0026rdquo; Big water means go all out. Small water typically means to save your big cooldowns and use whatever smaller heals you might have available.  "}),a.add({id:5,href:'/docs/wvw/builds/tempest/',title:"Tempest",section:"Builds",content:"Tempest\r#\r\rGW2Mists lists two elementalist builds: a support and a DPS.\nSupport Tempest (Frontline)\r#\r\rRotation\r#\r\rThe tempest is very rotation-focused. There is certainly some tactical thinking required, but less than with other classes. Your job is to rotate through your skills as fast as you can, applying and transmuting as many auras as you can. The precise order will depend on what weapons you\u0026rsquo;re using.\nWith focus, you generally start in air to do as much CC as you can and then switch to fire to blast and reapply the fire aura (Focus 5). Then you continually alternate back into fire whenever available. But you never overload fire! Your DPS and aura output suffers too much from the lengthy post-overload cooldown.\nWeapon Choice\r#\r\rThe only \u0026ldquo;acceptable\u0026rdquo; main-hand weapon for support tempest is dagger. It gives you one on-demand aura (Air 3) and decent CC options in most attunements.\nStaff is only acceptable for DPS builds or tempests focusing almost solely on healing. But scrappers heal better, and you give up too much (one on-demand aura instead of two and fewer defensive boons).\n focus This is the default off-hand weapon. It gives you access to a second powerful on-demand aura (Fire 5), lots of CC, and the always useful Earth 5 personal invulnerability. Because of the trait Fire: Pyromancer\u0026rsquo;s Puissance, you want to be swapping in and out of fire as much as possible. This is another reason why focus is the preferred off-hand. It gives you a very good reason to be coming back to fire again and again. dagger This at least gets you a second on-demand aura (Water 4) that can be transmuted. It also gives you an additional on-demand heal (Water 5). It gives you more damage in fire and earth, and more mobility in air. But again, in a well-designed comp squad, specialists are preferred over generalists. Off-hand focus will maximize your unique contributions. warhorn This gives you access to an on-demand magnetic aura (Earth 4), but it cannot be transmuted. So you lose some cleanse potential. What it does give you is some directional healing skills in water. But again, scrappers heal better than you do anyway, and losing fire aura is a big loss.  Trait Options\r#\r\rThere\u0026rsquo;s very little trait flexibility with support tempests. It\u0026rsquo;s the combination of the three traits Water: Powerful Aura, Fire: Smothering Ashes, and Tempest: Elemental Bastion that make this build tick. Without them, your utility drops dramatically.\nThe only room to manoeuvre is in Tempest column 2.\nUtility Skills\r#\r\rAssuming you took Tempest: Tempestuous Aria, then your utility skills are going to be shouts. The might this trait generates synergizes with Fire: Pyromancer\u0026rsquo;s Puissance.\nSwapping in \u0026ldquo;Aftershock!\u0026rdquo; for other shouts is of course acceptable, but \u0026ldquo;Eye of the Storm!\u0026rdquo; is very valuable. You typically shouldn\u0026rsquo;t choose any non-shout utilities unless you are choosing a different Tempest column 2 trait.\nPersonal Notes\r#\r\rHaele\r#\r\rI play dagger/focus. I always start in air. I try to be right up front so my CC and weakness are most effective. After overloading air I immediately swap to fire to transmute and reapply my fire aura. I\u0026rsquo;ll often drop a fire line in the middle of the zerg if I can. Never overload fire!\nThen I tend to switch to earth for more CC. I try to delay water as long as I can, but I won\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to switch to it if things are getting hairy. But I keep switching in and out of fire whenever it becomes available, and I tend to favour air whenever it\u0026rsquo;s available for the very powerful overload.\nI use \u0026ldquo;Eye of the Storm!\u0026rdquo; if we\u0026rsquo;re chasing and just need that extra boost of speed or when we\u0026rsquo;re getting stunned. I tend to save my other shouts for when tag calls for CC as opposed using it for cleansing, though I will if my weapon skills aren\u0026rsquo;t keeping us cleansed enough.\nUse your heal skill liberally and use \u0026ldquo;Rebound!\u0026rdquo; if anyone in your party is running low on health.\nI stream more firebrand than tempest, but you can see some videos of me playing tempest on my Twitch channel.\n"}),a.add({id:6,href:'/docs/wvw/equip/',title:"Equipment",section:"WvW 101",content:"Equipment\r#\r\rExotic equipment is sufficient for World vs. World.
