      <title>The Basics</title>

      <description>The Basics#The core party composition is a support firebrand (primarily for stability), a scrapper (for healing), and a scourge (for condi damage, shields, and boon rips). The remaining two slots are where we can get creative.
At its most simplistic, builds are described in terms of role (DPS vs. support) and position (frontline vs. backline).
Role#In an ideal comp, nobody is a one-trick pony. But it&amp;rsquo;s important to know what your primary role is.</description>

      <description>Etiquette#Running with a squad is like a team sport. To be successful, everyone should understand the fundamentals and adhere to certain basic &amp;ldquo;rules.&amp;rdquo; These basic rules of etiquette apply to any squad you may find yourself in.
  Stay on tag. We cannot stress this enough. If you can&amp;rsquo;t see the tag, you are probably in the wrong place.
  Trust your commander. Even if the lord is at 5%, if the tag says to follow, do it.</description>

      <description>Guardian#GW2Mists lists multiple guardian builds. The most common, and the one we need for every single party in the zerg, is the Healbrand. The others can be slotted in to the flex spots, but they cannot replace a proper Healbrand.
Notes on Firebrand Tomes#Anet did what they could to make the tomes quite straightforward to use. The Firebrand page on the GW2 wiki makes it easy to see what they all do.</description>

      <description>Commander Calls#You may hear the commander call out various words and phrases at certain points. Here&amp;rsquo;s what they mean. Don&amp;rsquo;t ever hesitate to ask, either in the chat or in Discord, if you have any questions or would like to see new terms added.
 blast This is usually called right after stealth. It means to use a blast finisher skill inside of a smoke field to create area stealth.</description>

      <description>Tempest#GW2Mists lists two elementalist builds: a support and a DPS.
Support Tempest (Frontline)#Rotation#The tempest is very rotation-focused. There is certainly some tactical thinking required, but less than with other classes. Your job is to rotate through your skills as fast as you can, applying and transmuting as many auras as you can. The precise order will depend on what weapons you&amp;rsquo;re using.</description>

      <description>Equipment#Exotic equipment is sufficient for World vs. World. The stat difference between exotic and ascended gear is around 10% – rarely enough to determine a fight. And by playing WvW you will naturally earn Warlord&amp;rsquo;s Armor Boxes, which give you stat-selectable exotic armour. For a discussion of which stats you want on your equipment, please see the Builds article.
If you want to start building an ascended equipment set, start with the trinkets, which are cheaper to get.</description>
