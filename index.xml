      <description>PvP Screen#The PvP screen is opened by clicking the crossed sword button in the menu bar (see above image). The rest of this section explains elements of each of the different tabs.
Home#1: PvP Lobby#You can start PvP games from anywhere in Tyria, but there is a dedicated area called the Heart of the Mists. Like WvW, there&amp;rsquo;s a bank, Black Lion trader, and various vendors, both general and PvP-specific.</description>

      <title>The Basics</title>
      <link>https://tyrian-misfits.github.io/docs/wvw/builds/basics/</link>

      <guid>https://tyrian-misfits.github.io/docs/wvw/builds/basics/</guid>
      <description>The Basics#The core party composition is a support firebrand (primarily for stability), a scrapper (for healing), and a scourge (for condi damage, shields, and boon rips). The remaining two slots are where we can get creative.
At its most simplistic, builds are described in terms of role (DPS vs. support) and position (frontline vs. backline).
Role#In an ideal comp, nobody is a one-trick pony. But it&amp;rsquo;s important to know what your primary role is.</description>

      <description>Elementalist#GW2Mists lists two elementalist builds: a support and a DPS.
Support Tempest (Frontline)#Rotation#The tempest is very rotation-focused. There is certainly some tactical thinking required, but less than with other classes. Your job is to rotate through your skills as fast as you can, applying and transmuting as many auras as you can. The precise order will depend on what weapons you&amp;rsquo;re using.</description>

      <description>Etiquette#Running with a squad is like a team sport. To be successful, everyone should understand the fundamentals and adhere to certain basic &amp;ldquo;rules.&amp;rdquo; These basic rules of etiquette apply to any squad you may find yourself in.
  Stay on tag. We cannot stress this enough. If you can&amp;rsquo;t see the tag, you are probably in the wrong place.
  Trust your commander. Even if the lord is at 5%, if the tag says to follow, do it.</description>

      <description>Game Modes#Conquest#Conquest is the primary PvP mode. There are nine different maps with three control nodes each. Each also has a unique mechanic – some of which earn you points directly, others of which grant various bonuses.
 Two teams of five battle it out. The winner is either the first team to 500 points or the team with the most points after 15 minutes.</description>

      <description>Builds#Equipment#PvP is the easiest game mode to get started with because you don&amp;rsquo;t need any special gear! In PvP, all your stats are normalized. Everyone is on a level playing field. All you need are starter armour and weapons. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any trinkets. None of the stats matter.

      <title>Commander Calls</title>

      <guid>https://tyrian-misfits.github.io/docs/wvw/calls/</guid>
      <description>Commander Calls#You may hear the commander call out various words and phrases at certain points. Here&amp;rsquo;s what they mean. Don&amp;rsquo;t ever hesitate to ask, either in the chat or in Discord, if you have any questions or would like to see new terms added.
 blast This is usually called right after stealth. It means to use a blast finisher skill inside of a smoke field to create area stealth.</description>

      <guid>https://tyrian-misfits.github.io/docs/wvw/builds/engineer/</guid>
      <description>Engineer#GW2Mists lists two workable engineer builds: heal scrapper and power scrapper.
Heal Scrapper (Frontline)#Frontline Med-Kit Scrapper
You serve five important functions: stealth, mitigate damage, cleanse, heal, and revive.
Stealth#When commander calls for stealth, use your elite skill Sneak Gyro, which drops a smoke field. Then use your Medkit 5 skill Infusion Bomb, which is a blast finisher.
Pro tip: Double tap Medkit 5 first, then click Sneak Gyro, since Infusion Bomb has a small delay to blast.</description>

      <guid>https://tyrian-misfits.github.io/docs/wvw/equip/</guid>
      <description>Equipment#Exotic equipment is sufficient for World vs. World. The stat difference between exotic and ascended gear is around 10% – rarely enough to determine a fight. And by playing WvW you will naturally earn Warlord&amp;rsquo;s Armor Boxes, which give you stat-selectable exotic armour. For a discussion of which stats you want on your equipment, please see the Builds article.
If you want to start building an ascended equipment set, start with the trinkets, which are cheaper to get.</description>

      <description>Further Resources# GodsOfPvP is not only a good source for common builds, it also has an extensive guides section that discusses game settings, individual map mechanics, and strategies. Vallun is a prolific YouTuber with many helpful thoughts on PvP mechanics and builds. He also talks a fair bit about WvW.  </description>

      <guid>https://tyrian-misfits.github.io/docs/wvw/builds/guardian/</guid>
      <description>Guardian#GW2Mists lists multiple guardian builds. The most common, and the one we need for every single party in the zerg, is the Healbrand. The others can be slotted in to the flex spots, but they cannot replace a proper Healbrand.
Notes on Firebrand Tomes#Anet did what they could to make the tomes quite straightforward to use. The Firebrand page on the GW2 wiki makes it easy to see what they all do.</description>

      <guid>https://tyrian-misfits.github.io/docs/wvw/builds/necromancer/</guid>
      <description>Necromancer#GW2Mists lists two necromancer builds: a scourge and a reaper. But below are two other builds to consider.
Condi Scourge (Backline)#Kora&amp;rsquo;s Condi Scourge
Your main goal is to spam conditions on the enemies with your AoE attacks with staff and sand shades. Use your wells/serpent siphon along with F5 (Shroud) when tag asks for bombs. Keep your staff marks on walls when we’re sieging. Use scepter 3 (devouring darkness) off cooldown to remove boons from enemies.</description>

      <description>Revenant#GW2Mists only lists a single zerg build for revenant: the power herald.
Power Herald (Backline)#Power Herald
Gear: Use a mixture of Berserker’s and Assassin’s gear. Your goal is to get your crit chance to 60% so you will have a 100% crit rate when you have fury. The trait Rolling Mists doubles the effectiveness of fury, resulting in fury granting you 40% additional crit chance.</description>
