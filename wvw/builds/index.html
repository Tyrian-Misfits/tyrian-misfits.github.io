<h1>Builds</h1>


<p>TM does not require specific builds. Play classes you enjoy. That said, there <em>are</em> ideal builds for most classes that fill common roles WvW squads need. If you wish to start exploring those, the best place to start is an up-to-date build website. We recommend <a href="https://gw2mists.com/">GW2Mists</a>. In the Discord there are specific channels dedicated for discussions and questions around specific classes, and occasionally we hold class-specific training sessions.</p>
<p>Another site you will hear mentioned a lot is <a href="https://metabattle.com">MetaBattle</a>. While this site is helpful, it tends to lag behind the current &ldquo;meta.&rdquo; What this site <em>does</em> have that GW2Mists does not are detailed explanations of how the builds work, including, often, rotation lists. Even if the build you go with does not perfectly match a MetaBattle build, their Usage sections will likely still be valuable.</p>
<h2 id="comp-night">&ldquo;Comp Night&rdquo;</h2>
<p>TM does run &ldquo;comp nights&rdquo; on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On those nights we run closed squads (members only) and practice our skills. Members who want to participate are encouraged to choose particular builds to form a diverse and well-tuned core group.</p>
<p><strong>Participation is voluntary!</strong> We do not require members to play builds they don&rsquo;t want to play, and all members are welcome at each and every run.</p>
<p>Below are some articles on particular classes and builds we prefer. Builds listed on <a href="https://gw2mists.com/">GW2Mists</a> are <em>always</em> acceptable. Custom builds, articles, and tutorial videos are listed below.</p>
