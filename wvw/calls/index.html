<p>You may hear the commander call out various words and phrases at certain points. Here&rsquo;s what they mean. Don&rsquo;t ever hesitate to ask, either in the chat or in Discord, if you have any questions or would like to see new terms added.</p>
<dl>
<dt>blast</dt>
<dd>This is usually called right after <em>stealth</em>. It means to use a <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blast_finisher">blast finisher</a> skill inside of a <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Smoke_field">smoke field</a> to create area stealth. See <em>stealth</em> for details.</dd>
<dt>finish the downs</dt>
<dd>Means to backtrack a little and be sure to finish all the of the downed enemies. This usually means &ldquo;cleave,&rdquo; meaning do as much damage as you can. &ldquo;Stomping&rdquo; (pressing the Finish key) generally takes too long.</dd>
<dt>might up</dt>
<dd>This typically refers to the Guardian staff 4 skill <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Empower">Empower</a>, but you can use <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Might">any skill that grants might</a> to allies.</dd>
<dt>pvd</dt>
<dd>Means &ldquo;player vs. door.&rdquo; When called, it means to use your autoattack on the gate being sieged. We often do this if the gate is low and the rams have been disabled.</dd>
<dt>stack; stack up</dt>
<dd>It simply means get on tag. This is so, so important. Stealth, might, healing, all of it relies on people being close together. So stack up!</dd>
<dt>stealth</dt>
<dd>Some classes have skills that create a <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Smoke_field">smoke field</a>. When smoke fields are <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blast_finisher">blasted</a>, they give stealth to people within the field. For this to work, you must keep in mind the following:
<ul>
<li>Hide your minatures in WvW. They don&rsquo;t stealth and give away our position.</li>
<li>Get off your mount. You can&rsquo;t stealth while mounted.</li>
<li>When stealth is called, do not use <em>any</em> skill that creates a <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Combo">combo field</a> other than smoke! <strong>This is so important!</strong> Do not use <em>any</em> skill once stealth has been called unless you know what you&rsquo;re doing.</li>
<li>Once the smoke fields are down, if you have a blast finisher, use it immediately, but then do not use any other skill, to avoid revealing yourself.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>sustain</dt>
<dd>Refers to skills that keep the group alive, such as healing, cleansing, and aegis.</dd>
<dt>water</dt>
<dd>Refers to healing. You might hear terms like &ldquo;big water&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;small water.&rdquo; Big water means go all out. Small water typically means to save your big cooldowns and use whatever smaller heals you might have available.</dd>
