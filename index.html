<h2 id="who-are-we">Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are group of open, friendly, and inclusive adults who love playing <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com">Guild Wars 2</a> together. We are primarily a World vs. World guild based on the <strong>Gates of Madness server</strong>, but we also have many PvE and PvP players. We have an active Discord server and a minor Facebook presence.</p>
<p>See our <a href="http://calendar.tyrianmisfits.com">guild event calendar</a> for a full list of scheduled events.</p>
<h2 id="who-can-join">Who can join?</h2>
<p>We are a teaching guild. We accept members of all experience levels and do not require specific builds. But we will teach you how to succeed and guide you if you wish to take things to the next level. Our only requirement is that you be kind to each other. Always remember, this is a game. It&rsquo;s supposed to be fun and enjoyable. It happens to be more fun together.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-join">How do I join?</h2>
<p>To join, please reach out to any member of the guild. You can also contact any of the following accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>BGCpk.8476</li>
<li>ChainedOne.7369</li>
<li>lightliger.3024</li>
<li>Perlkonig.3247</li>
<li>Kaiiku.2917</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guild-structure">Guild Structure</h2>
<p>Our hierarchy is minimal. New members start as <strong>Mini Misfits</strong>. After a period of activity and participation, they become full-blown <strong>Misfits</strong>. This is where most members live. Members who take on specific responsibilities and require additional permissions become <strong>Champion Misfits</strong>. These members should exemplify the best of TM. The <strong>Alpha</strong> and <strong>Omega Misfits</strong> are our &ldquo;founding fathers.&rdquo; After six months of inactivity, members may be moved to the <strong>Emeritus</strong> rank, but we warmly welcome returning players.</p>
<p>In TM, we are all leaders. Members should feel comfortable reaching out to any member with questions or concerns. When diplomacy fails, the Champion Misfits are empowered as a group to make decisions in the best interest of the guild. The Alphas and Omegas of course have ultimate authority.</p>
