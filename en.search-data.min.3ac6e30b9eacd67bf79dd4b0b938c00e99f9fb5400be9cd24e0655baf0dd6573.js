The rest of this section explains elements of each of the different tabs.\nHome\r#\r\r1: PvP Lobby\r#\r\rYou can start PvP games from anywhere in Tyria, but there is a dedicated area called the Heart of the Mists. Like WvW, there\u0026rsquo;s a bank, Black Lion trader, and various vendors, both general and PvP-specific. Also like WvW, the game remembers what your build and equipment were when you last entered the Mists with that character. Leaving the mists will take you back to the zone you were last in.\nThere are numerous golems and NPCs in the practice area to try out your new build, and, if you\u0026rsquo;re feeling really frisky, there\u0026rsquo;s also a free-for-all arena.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lounge, but without the pass, there are no crafting stations here.\n2: Unranked Arena\r#\r\rThe names of these arenas are wrong. This should actually be called \u0026ldquo;Unrated Arena.\u0026rdquo; You do indeed still earn rank points (your PvP \u0026ldquo;level\u0026rdquo;) in this arena, but your game will not be rated (see the League section for details).\nAlso, the name of the permanent daily \u0026ldquo;Daily PvP Rated Game Winner\u0026rdquo; is wrong. It should actually be called \u0026ldquo;Daily PvP Ranked Game Winner.\u0026rdquo; You can complete this daily by winning a game in the Unranked Arena.\nIn this arena you can enter the queue with up to a full 5-person party. You will be pitted against players of very disparate skills, and the results will not affect your rating. You also earn reward track points. This is a great place to try out new builds and play with guildies.\n3: Ranked Arena\r#\r\rThis, too, should be called \u0026ldquo;Rated Arena.\u0026rdquo; In addition to rank points and reward track points, you also earn skirmish track pips. This is how you earn special PvP-only currencies (PvP League Tickets and Ascended Shards of Glory) used for crafting legendaries and buying ascended gear, as well as earning hefty amounts of gold, dyes, warlord armor chests, and grandmaster mark shard boxes. PvP can actually be quite lucrative.\n4: Rank\r#\r\rThere is no limit to the number of PvP ranks you can earn, but up until level 80, every 10 levels earns you a new animal and animal-specific finisher. The order is given on the GW2 wiki. Your current numerical level is visible in the bottom left of your screen. The progress bar replaces your normal experience bar.\n5: Preferences\r#\r\rThere are two different PvP game modes: Conquest and Stronghold (see Game Modes article for details). The unranked arena is always Conquest, but in unranked you can also play Stronghold. When you enter the Unranked Arena, it will randomly assign you to one of the modes you selected. In this screen capture, the player has chosen to only ever play Conquest mode.\n6: Statistics\r#\r\rAs you play, the game will accumulate various statistics about your play.\n7: Game History\r#\r\rThe results of your last 10 games will be shown here.\nLeague\r#\r\r1: Rating\r#\r\rThis box shows your current rating. If you don\u0026rsquo;t play for a few days, your rating starts to decay. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter unless you\u0026rsquo;re trying to climb the leaderboard. It also shows your current win/loss ratio for the season.\n2: Rating Scale\r#\r\rThis is just a graphical representation of your rating. There are five divisions: Bronze (0–900), Silver (900–1200), Gold (1200–1500), Platinum (1500–1800), and Legendary (1800+). There are typically no more than a couple of legendary players.\n3: Leaderboard\r#\r\rHere you can see how you stack up against other players. The \u0026ldquo;Friends and Guilds\u0026rdquo; is fun to watch. The \u0026ldquo;Minimum games required\u0026rdquo; number is simply how many games you have to play to appear on the leaderboard. That number increases as the season progresses.\n4: Skirmish Track\r#\r\rThis is the whole reason to play in the Ranked Arena! There are six total chests. The last one is repeatable. Losing a game earns you 3–4 pips; winning, 10–11. Pips earn you dots, and dots earn you rewards. The more often you win, the faster you earn. But even if you lose all the time, you can still grind out the components you need for legendary gear.\nTournaments\r#\r\rAutomated tournaments run every three hours. This is not usually a place for newcomers, so you needn\u0026rsquo;t worry about this right now, but the loot can be quite attractive. Placing well in regular tournaments earns you qualifying points to enter the big monthly tournament.\nSee the GW2 wiki tournaments page for more details.\nReward Tracks\r#\r\rAll the core reward tracks you\u0026rsquo;ll recognize from WvW are here too, including the one-time-only tracks that give bonus clovers!! There are a number of PvP-specific tracks as well. More loot!\nMist Champions\r#\r\rThe mist champions are used in the Stronghold game mode. This is where you manage your unlocked champions.\nGame Browser\r#\r\rFor 200 gold you can purchase your very own PvP arena. Not cheap. There are a number of arenas dedicated just to dailies that are populated by bots, but really, Unranked Arena is simply more fun.\nSee the Custom Arena page on the GW2 wiki for details.\n"}),a.add({id:3,href:'/docs/wvw/builds/basics/',title:"The Basics",section:"Builds",content:"The Basics\r#\r\rThe core party composition is a support firebrand (primarily for stability), a scrapper (for healing), and a scourge (for condi damage, shields, and boon rips). The remaining two slots are where we can get creative.\nAt its most simplistic, builds are described in terms of role (DPS vs. support) and position (frontline vs. backline).\nRole\r#\r\rIn an ideal comp, nobody is a one-trick pony. But it\u0026rsquo;s important to know what your primary role is. It guides all the decisions you make.\nDPS builds run stats that focus on damage, which makes them squishy, and their choice of utility skills will generally lean towards maximizing damage.\nSupport builds run stats that focus on healing and boon duration, and their job is to allow the DPSers to do the maximum amount of damage.\nYes there are hybrid builds, but in a solid comp, you will generally favour specialists over generalists. It\u0026rsquo;s simply more effective.\nPosition\r#\r\rFrontline builds are designed to be right in the thick of things; they\u0026rsquo;re tanky. Frontline DPS builds focus on burst damage and CC, keeping enemies occupied and away from the back line. Frontline support builds typically provide offensive boons and conditions to help the DPSers do as much damage as possible in a push.\nBackline builds hold back, but just a little. Unless you have supports dedicated to you, it\u0026rsquo;s important to stay within, say, 900 units of the tag. That\u0026rsquo;s where most of the support is focused.\nBackline DPS builds focus on ranged weapons and can typically do massive amounts of damage, but they tend to crumble in a frontal assault. Backline supports will help with reflects and other defensive boons to keep the back line mobile and effective.\n"}),a.add({id:4,href:'/docs/wvw/',title:"WvW 101",section:"Docs",content:"WvW 101\r#\r\rTM is a training guild.

There is certainly some tactical thinking required, but less than with other classes. Your job is to rotate through your skills as fast as you can, applying and transmuting as many auras as you can. The precise order will depend on what weapons you\u0026rsquo;re using.\nWith focus, you generally start in air to do as much CC as you can and then switch to fire to blast and reapply the fire aura (Focus 5). Then you continually alternate back into fire whenever available. But you never overload fire! Your DPS and aura output suffers too much from the lengthy post-overload cooldown.\nWeapon Choice\r#\r\rThe only \u0026ldquo;acceptable\u0026rdquo; main-hand weapon for support tempest is dagger. It gives you one on-demand aura (Air 3) and decent CC options in most attunements.\nStaff is only acceptable for DPS builds or tempests focusing almost solely on healing. But scrappers heal better, and you give up too much (one on-demand aura instead of two and fewer defensive boons).\n focus This is the default off-hand weapon. It gives you access to a second powerful on-demand aura (Fire 5), lots of CC, and the always useful Earth 5 personal invulnerability. Because of the trait Fire: Pyromancer\u0026rsquo;s Puissance, you want to be swapping in and out of fire as much as possible. This is another reason why focus is the preferred off-hand. It gives you a very good reason to be coming back to fire again and again. dagger This at least gets you a second on-demand aura (Water 4) that can be transmuted. It also gives you an additional on-demand heal (Water 5). It gives you more damage in fire and earth, and more mobility in air. But again, in a well-designed comp squad, specialists are preferred over generalists. Off-hand focus will maximize your unique contributions. warhorn This gives you access to an on-demand magnetic aura (Earth 4), but it cannot be transmuted. So you lose some cleanse potential. What it does give you is some directional healing skills in water. But again, scrappers heal better than you do anyway, and losing fire aura is a big loss.  Trait Options\r#\r\rThere\u0026rsquo;s very little trait flexibility with support tempests. It\u0026rsquo;s the combination of the three traits Water: Powerful Aura, Fire: Smothering Ashes, and Tempest: Elemental Bastion that make this build tick. Without them, your utility drops dramatically.\nThe only room to manoeuvre is in Tempest column 2.\nUtility Skills\r#\r\rAssuming you took Tempest: Tempestuous Aria, then your utility skills are going to be shouts. The might this trait generates synergizes with Fire: Pyromancer\u0026rsquo;s Puissance.\nSwapping in \u0026ldquo;Aftershock!\u0026rdquo; for other shouts is of course acceptable, but \u0026ldquo;Eye of the Storm!\u0026rdquo; is very valuable. You typically shouldn\u0026rsquo;t choose any non-shout utilities unless you are choosing a different Tempest column 2 trait.\nPersonal Notes\r#\r\rHaele\r#\r\rI play dagger/focus. I always start in air. I try to be right up front so my CC and weakness are most effective. After overloading air I immediately swap to fire to transmute and reapply my fire aura. I\u0026rsquo;ll often drop a fire line in the middle of the zerg if I can. Never overload fire!\nThen I tend to switch to earth for more CC. I try to delay water as long as I can, but I won\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to switch to it if things are getting hairy. But I keep switching in and out of fire whenever it becomes available, and I tend to favour air whenever it\u0026rsquo;s available for the very powerful overload.\nI use \u0026ldquo;Eye of the Storm!\u0026rdquo; if we\u0026rsquo;re chasing and just need that extra boost of speed or when we\u0026rsquo;re getting stunned. I tend to save my other shouts for when tag calls for CC as opposed using it for cleansing, though I will if my weapon skills aren\u0026rsquo;t keeping us cleansed enough.\nUse your heal skill liberally and use \u0026ldquo;Rebound!\u0026rdquo; if anyone in your party is running low on health.\nI stream more firebrand than tempest, but you can see some videos of me playing tempest on my Twitch channel.\n"}),a.add({id:6,href:'/docs/wvw/etiquette/',title:"Etiquette",section:"WvW 101",content:"Etiquette\r#\r\rRunning with a squad is like a team sport. To be successful, everyone should understand the fundamentals and adhere to certain basic \u0026ldquo;rules.\u0026rdquo; These basic rules of etiquette apply to any squad you may find yourself in.\n  Stay on tag. We cannot stress this enough. If you can\u0026rsquo;t see the tag, you are probably in the wrong place.\n  Trust your commander. Even if the lord is at 5%, if the tag says to follow, do it. It might be a mistake, but you only hurt the commander\u0026rsquo;s plan by not being there when they need you. Commanders do make mistakes. It\u0026rsquo;s OK. It\u0026rsquo;s how we learn.\n  When you are not on tag, you create a \u0026ldquo;tail.\u0026rdquo; This means that when a fight is engaged, not everybody will be there at the same time. This can lead to avoidable wipes.\n  When you are not on tag and you have supply, then our count of available supply will be off. This can lead to wasted siege or dangerous delays that can lead to wipes.\n  There are roamers that follow squads just to pick off their tails. As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re not on tag, you\u0026rsquo;re a bag.\u0026rdquo; It is much safer to be with the main body of the squad.\n    Don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;squirrel.\u0026rdquo; This is the main reason people end up off tag, and often end up dead. Squirreling is when you leave the group to go after an enemy. If you want to roam, that\u0026rsquo;s totally fine! But then you should leave the squad. If you are in the squad, you should be with the squad (unless you\u0026rsquo;re a designated scout).\nIf you do chose to squirrel and find yourself in trouble, please do not call out for help. We can\u0026rsquo;t be turning around a 30-man squad to chase one roamer. Chalk it up to experience and make your way back to the tag as quickly as you can.\n  Be in voice comms if you can. You should not feel pressured to participate. You can mute. But it is very helpful if you can hear what the commander is saying. If you can\u0026rsquo;t join voice, do be very attentive to squad chat and where the tag is going.\n  Keep voice comms clear during fights. The live banter is the heart and soul of a guild run. We love it! But when things get hot, please put down the conversation and give the commander the room not just to think but to communicate clearly to the rest of the squad.\n  If you are defeated, unless victory is imminent, waypoint and make your way back to squad as quickly as you can.\n  Never throw siege. This is the commander\u0026rsquo;s sole prerogative.\n  When sieging an objective, here\u0026rsquo;s the order of operations:\n First clear enemy rams or catapults in the way. Then build any siege the commander drops. And build fast! If you have supply, and you see something that needs building, build it! If you are a healer or support with reflects, stay with the siege and protect it. If you have ranged damage, clear the walls of guards, siege, and squirrels. Otherwise, if you have siege mastery, use any available siege. Everyone else, see rule #1.    Don\u0026rsquo;t claim objectives unless told to. Please leave that decision up to the commander or delegate.\n  Hide your miniatures when in WvW. They don\u0026rsquo;t stealth and give away our position.\n  When stacking, get off your mount unless the commander tells you to mount up. You can\u0026rsquo;t stealth while mounted.\n  When the commander calls \u0026ldquo;stealth\u0026rdquo;, stop using any skills unless you know they won\u0026rsquo;t interfere. See the Commander Calls page for more details.\n  "}),a.add({id:7,href:'/docs/pvp/modes/',title:"Game Modes",section:"PvP 101",content:"Game Modes\r#\r\rConquest\r#\r\rConquest is the primary PvP mode. There are nine different maps with three control nodes each. Each also has a unique mechanic – some of which earn you points directly, others of which grant various bonuses.\n Two teams of five battle it out. The winner is either the first team to 500 points or the team with the most points after 15 minutes. You earn 5 points for every kill. Every 2 seconds, you earn 1 point per node owned. You take control of a node by standing within the circle.  If there is an enemy in the circle with you, nothing happens. If you are alone in the circle and it belongs to the enemy, you will slowly \u0026ldquo;decap\u0026rdquo; the node. If you are alone in the circle and it\u0026rsquo;s neutral, then the node will slowly become yours.   As long as a node has not been neutralized, it will still earn your team points, even if it\u0026rsquo;s being actively contested.  Mental Health Hygiene\r#\r\rPlaying with strangers can be frustrating. In PvE, the game is designed to minimize griefing and toxicity. In WvW, griefing is common, but communication is blocked, and you can run in larger groups for protection. In PvP, however, not only are you in direct competition with strangers and have minimal control over who you play with, all communication channels are open.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re the type of person that loves the trash talking game and isn\u0026rsquo;t bothered by it, then great. You\u0026rsquo;ve found your home.\nFor those of us who find such communication bothersome, we recommend creating a chat tab that only contains /team chat and disabling world chat bubbles. And don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to block anybody toxic on your team or anyone who whispers you.\nKeep Perspective\r#\r\r  Find the fun and focus on it. It\u0026rsquo;s a game; it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be fun. If you\u0026rsquo;re not having fun, take a break. If you find yourself wanting to come back, understand what it is that\u0026rsquo;s drawing you in and focus on that as you play.\n  Be kind to yourself. GW2 has one of the deepest combat systems of any MMORPG, and the skill ceiling is actually quite high. You will find yourself on the receiving end of a massive whooping and be left asking \u0026ldquo;how the heck did they do that\u0026rdquo;? Be patient and know that focused effort and practice will make you a better player.\n  At the same time, you can only control yourself. You\u0026rsquo;re going to encounter frustrating bots. You\u0026rsquo;re going to run into players who go AFK or win trade. And you\u0026rsquo;re also going to be grouped with people who are trying but are simply worse players than you. Yes this is frustrating, but if you want to improve, don\u0026rsquo;t blame them for your loss. You can\u0026rsquo;t do anything about them. Focus on what you did well and on what you can improve. There\u0026rsquo;s always something.\n  Gameplay Essentials\r#\r\r Don\u0026rsquo;t die. After you die, there\u0026rsquo;s a 15-second cooldown before you respawn. This gives the enemy team a massive advantage. Yes, you\u0026rsquo;re going to die – a lot in the beginning – but the first thing you should learn how to do is die less. Your goal is to die no more than three times in any given match. Learn what your class\u0026rsquo;s disengage skills are (the skills that let you get away from a fight). Learn how to use the terrain to find reprieve and heal up. Learn when it\u0026rsquo;s time to get the heck out and when it\u0026rsquo;s truly your time to take a stand. Focus on the nodes. This is a more accurate translation of the advice \u0026ldquo;Fight on point!\u0026rdquo; that you will hear shouted in games time and time again. Games are usually won by consistent control of the nodes (you consistently have more nodes than the enemy does).  If you\u0026rsquo;re near a node you don\u0026rsquo;t own, you want to be within that circle as much as you safely can (but see rule #1). If you\u0026rsquo;re defending your own node, then fighting \u0026ldquo;off point\u0026rdquo; is exactly what you want. You want to keep them off your node as long as you can. If they\u0026rsquo;ll let you kite them around, great. If you find yourself fighting for no reason in the middle of nowhere, you\u0026rsquo;re likely in the wrong place. Disengage and go do some good.   Be aware of your surroundings. Tunnel vision will get you killed. Always be aware of what\u0026rsquo;s going on around you. How many of them are there? Any more coming? What are your teammates doing? What terrain is available for when things get rough? Check your minimap constantly. Learning to read your minimap and checking it often is another essential skill. Your teammates are always visible, and any enemies near them will also be visible. When you\u0026rsquo;re not sure what to do, check the minimap. What nodes do you own? Where is everybody? What\u0026rsquo;s the score? These will all inform your decision. Maximize your value. This is the definition of becoming a better PvP player. Understand your role (see the Builds article), and learn what to do in any given moment that will earn your team the most points. Here are some general principles that might help:  Don\u0026rsquo;t start an outnumbered fight. Unless you know you will win, walk away. If you become outnumbered at a node, then your best option is usually to keep them there and occupied as long as possible to give your team the advantage at other nodes. Use terrain to extend your life. Sometimes disengaging is sensible, but if you can keep yourself alive for a good while, then dragging out the inevitable is often the best call. The corollary to this is, if you see a teammate outnumbered at a node, depending on your role and theirs, it may be best to leave them there! If it\u0026rsquo;s 2v1 at that node, it means it\u0026rsquo;s 3v4 everywhere else. Take advantage of that. Remember that you can only control yourself. If you find yourself in a situation that doesn\u0026rsquo;t match your role, get the heck out and make yourself useful.    Stronghold\r#\r\rNothing to see here. If this is a game mode you enjoy and would like to share information with the rest of the guild, please let one of the officers know.

Knowing your role is essential to deciding what to do in any given moment of the game. GodsOfPvP helpfully labels its builds with its primary role.\n DPS These are classes that deal big damage but have little self-sustain. They will always try to stay in a group (a teamfight) and will rely on their supports. Support These are the healers and boon givers. They rarely do much damage on their own. So like DPSers, they prefer teamfights Duelist/Sidenoder These builds excel in 1v1 and are competitive (at least durable) in 1vX. They avoid teamfights, preferring to take and protect nodes on their own. Roamer These classes are highly mobile and have strong damage. Because of their mobility, their two main jobs are to quickly decap enemy nodes and to \u0026ldquo;+1\u0026rdquo; fights to rack up kills.

It means to use a blast finisher skill inside of a smoke field to create area stealth. See stealth for details. bomb This means to do the maximum amount of damage you can at that moment and in that place. For supports, it\u0026rsquo;s the time you pull out all the stops to ensure the DPSers in your party are maximally effective (e.g., quickness, alacrity, might, Winds of Disenchantment). It is generally wise to save your big skills for these calls.

So try to save a little for these calls.\n bubble This refers to the Spellbreaker elite Winds of Disenchantment. It drops a stationary bubble that, for enemies, both strips existing boons and prevents new boons from being applied. For allies, it reflects projectiles and creates a lightning field. It is best dropped on choke points or on the front line if the commander plans on being stationary for a few seconds. finish the downs Means to backtrack a little and be sure to finish all the of the downed enemies.

We often do this if the gate is low and the rams have been disabled. stack; stack up It simply means get on tag. This is so, so important. Stealth, might, healing, all of it relies on people being close together. So stack up! When stacking, always dismount! Also, do not use any skills that create a combo field unless ordered to do so.\n stealth Some classes have skills that create a smoke field. When smoke fields are blasted, they give stealth to people within the field. For this to work, you must keep in mind the following:  Hide your miniatures in WvW. They don\u0026rsquo;t stealth and give away our position. Get off your mount. You can\u0026rsquo;t stealth while mounted. When stealth is called, do not use any skill that creates a combo field other than smoke! This is so important! Do not use any skill once stealth has been called unless you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. Once the smoke fields are down, if you have a blast finisher, use it immediately, but then do not use any other skill, to avoid revealing yourself.   sustain Refers to skills that keep the group alive, such as healing, cleansing, and aegis. water Refers to healing. You might hear terms like \u0026ldquo;big water\u0026rdquo; vs. \u0026ldquo;small water.\u0026rdquo; Big water means go all out. Small water typically means to save your big cooldowns and use whatever smaller heals you might have available.

The most common, and the one we need for every single party in the zerg, is the Healbrand. The others can be slotted in to the flex spots, but they cannot replace a proper Healbrand.\nNotes on Firebrand Tomes\r#\r\rAnet did what they could to make the tomes quite straightforward to use. The Firebrand page on the GW2 wiki makes it easy to see what they all do. Here we refer to F1 as the Fire Tome, F2 as the Heal Tome, and F3 as the Boon Tome.\nThe Fire Tome focuses on burn damage. The Heal Tome gives you regen, healing, and condi cleanse. The Boon Tome gives you stability, protection, resistance, and reflect.\nThe skills for the three tomes all work in similar ways:\n Skill 1 sprays out in front of you in a cone. Skill 2 is a close-range AoE (240). Skill 3 is a targeted AoE (range 900, radius 240). Skill 4 is a medium-radius AoE (360) that also drops a combo field. Skill 5 is a large-radius AoE (600) that also grants special boons to allies.  Healbrand\r#\r\rThe core GW2Mists Healbrand build is perfectly serviceable, but there are minor variants.\nFrontline Aggressive (Commander)\r#\r\rFrontline Aggressive Healbrand\nThis is the build our commander tends to run. You\u0026rsquo;ll note the extra offensive mantras and the use of the axe, which gives a helpful pull when running down fleeing squirrels.\nThis build also chooses Valor over Virtues for extra self-sustain (additional self-only aegis, protection, toughness, and condition cleanse) and more frequent access to Boon Tome and shield skills. This build focuses more on weapon skills than virtues.\nWhile this is an acceptable variant, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the most common one in the squad.\nBoon Focused\r#\r\rGuardian healing will never compare with that of scrappers and even tempests. But guardians give a ton of helpful boons. So maximizing boon duration over healing power is also acceptable.\nBoon-Focused Healbrand\nThis build uses the standard mace for its defensive boons (skill #3 in particular) and Concentration sigils over Transference. It chooses Indomitable Courage over Battle Presence for the extra stability, and Magnanimous Maintenance Oil over the Bountiful for the extra boon duration (it is also significantly cheaper).\nRune of Water is a valid choice over Rune of the Monk.\nUtility Skills\r#\r\rYou will almost always run at the very least Mantra of Liberation as your elite and Mantra of Lore. \u0026ldquo;Stand Your Ground!\u0026rdquo; is another staple.\nMost heal slots are occupied with Mantra of Solace, but some do choose \u0026ldquo;Receive the Light!\u0026rdquo;.\nThat leaves one slot that can change depending on party and enemy composition. Here are the most common choices:\n Hallowed Ground: Fire field that grants pulsing stability (and quickness and retaliation, with the right traits). Purging Flames: Pulsing fire damage and condition cleanse. Signet of Mercy: Passively increases boon duration and revives downed allies. Wall of Reflection: Long-lasting projectile reflect, particularly useful at choke points.  Trait Options\r#\r\r Firebrand The standard choice for Firebrand column 2 is Stalwart Speed. But it has a 7 second internal cooldown. If your party is getting quickness from elsewhere, Legendary Lore is a good alternative. Honor Even if you\u0026rsquo;re not using a mace, Invigorated Bulwark is usually the best choice, but Protective Reviver is defensible without a mace. Pure of Voice is super helpful for \u0026ldquo;Stand Your Ground!\u0026rdquo;, but Force of Will is acceptable if you need increased healing output.\n  Personal Notes\r#\r\rHaele\r#\r\rI run the boon-focused build. \u0026ldquo;Stand Your Ground!\u0026rdquo; and empower last over 10 seconds. Boon Tome 5 stability and protection lasts 9. Aegis from mace 3 lasts over 14 seconds, and shield 4 for over 7.\nWhen stacking, I use staff 4 then 2. If we have a distance to run, then I\u0026rsquo;ll stay in staff and use 3 for swiftness or 5 for the line. I\u0026rsquo;ll generally pop \u0026ldquo;Stand Your Ground!\u0026rdquo; on our way to the encounter.\nAs we get within range, I\u0026rsquo;ll pop shield 5, and once we hit, shield 4 and mace 3 come out. From there, you have to see how the encounter is going.\nI favour the Boon Tome. Skills 5 and 4 are staples. If things are going well, then I may switch to Fire Tome for the skill 3 pull. I generally won\u0026rsquo;t switch to Heal Tome unless things are really dire or our scrapper has somehow succumbed.\nWhile you should generally not jeopardize your own life to help stragglers, you\u0026rsquo;re a guardian after all. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to resist. When we\u0026rsquo;re disengaging, there are things you can do to help. Turn around to face the tail and use shield 4, heal mantra, elite mantra, or Boon Tome 1 to help people catch up or avoid a pull.\nYou can watch me play on my Twitch channel.\nVideos\r#\r\r\r\r"}),a.add({id:15,href:'/docs/wvw/builds/',title:"Builds",section:"WvW 101",content:"Builds\r#\r\rTM does not require specific builds.

Your goal is to get your crit chance to 60% so you will have a 100% crit rate when you have fury. The trait Rolling Mists doubles the effectiveness of fury, resulting in fury granting you 40% additional crit chance.\nBuild variations: If and only if you are consistently top three in DPS do I recommend taking Devastation: Notoriety over Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Presence. Brutality and Swift Termination are also interchangeable, but I recommend Brutality if you\u0026rsquo;re new to Herald.\nGroup Role\r#\r\rHerald’s role in WvW is to output burst damage from range, which no other class can do quite as effectively. Herald also provides incredible damage reduction from skills such as Rite of the Great Dwarf and True Nature Dwarf, and our boon uptime is unmatched by other DPS classes. While classes like weaver can have better sustained damage and better cleave damage, they cannot match a herald’s burst.

If the spike results in downs, then follow up with a Coalescence of Ruin.\n\u0026ldquo;Superspeed\u0026rdquo; cast Chaotic Release (Glint’s elite). This is the only real use for this skill.\n“CCs out” use hammer 5 (Drop the Hammer) on the marked location.\nSkill Notes\r#\r\rSwap legends as much as possible. Don\u0026rsquo;t camp one legend for too long unless a cooldown like Elemental Blast/Inspiring Reinforcement is close to being ready (three seconds from being ready at the most).\nI recommend starting in Glint and initiating fights with Facet of Elements, Facet of Darkness, and Facet of Strength. The boons these provide are extraordinarily strong and give you additional damage through Forceful Persistence.\nWhen on Dwarf, always use True Nature Dwarf! It has a quarter-second cast time and doesn\u0026rsquo;t cost any energy. It provides three stacks of stability for four-and-a-half seconds. USE IT A LOT! On the other hand, True Nature Glint is worthless except for using it to activate Forceful Persistence.\nThe trait Herald: Forceful Persistence gives you 13% more damage when you have upkeep (e.g., facets on, Vengeful Hammers on). Try to have some type of upkeep when you use big skills like Coalescence of Ruin, Phase Smash, and Inspiring Reinforcement.\nBurst of Strength only applies its 7% damage buff if you hit an enemy with it (this one is for you, Dark).\nRite of the Great Dwarf (Jalis elite) is incredibly strong and expensive. Use it in situations when you can afford to use it, or if it’s available and you’re about to swap to Glint.\nRotations\r#\r\rDPS\r#\r\rHammer is Herald\u0026rsquo;s primary DPS weapon and should be camped 95% of the time in WvW. Sword/sword should only be used during prolonged melee engagements (10s+), or when the commander calls for melee. If your group is passing through the enemy group and not staying in melee, do not switch to sword/sword.\nYour main DPS skills are: Coalescence of Ruin, Phase Smash, Elemental Blast, and Inspiring Reinforcement. Try to have Forceful Persistence active while using these skills.\nVengeful Hammers should be toggled when available and passing through blobs.\nFrom Stealth\r#\r\rElemental Blast \u0026gt; legend swap to dwarf \u0026gt; Coalescence of Ruin \u0026gt; Inspiring Reinforcement. Then, if it does not put you out of position, True Nature (for Forceful Persistence) \u0026gt; Phase Smash. But remember, a dead player’s DPS is zero.\nVideo of this in action: https://streamable.com/cl6gzb (ty for letting me use this Kim ily you\u0026rsquo;re dope).\nAfter this combo stay in Jalis until you can use another Inspiring Reinforcement and then swap to Glint.\nAfter your opening combo use Coalescence of Ruin off of cooldown and Inspiring Reinforcement/Elemental Blast off of cooldown.
